        "Stocky, dark waterbirds that cruise around open ponds and marshes with a stark white bill and forehead shield. They often forage alongside ducks, but a closer look at their slim head and long lobed toes reveals that coots are actually rails, more closely related to Sandhill Cranes and secretive marsh birds than to true ducks.",

        "Gives series of short clucks, croaks, and grunts, often strung together into chattering, mechanical-sounding phrases.",
      calls:
        "Loud cackles, honks, and squawks used in contact, aggression, and alarm when squabbling on the water.",
      otherSounds:
        "Splashy, slapping footsteps as they run across the water during takeoff or fights, plus noisy wingbeats over the pond.",

Brought back from near-extinction after DDT was banned in 1972.",
