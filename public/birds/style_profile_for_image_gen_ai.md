Style profile (BirdBingo Watercolor Cards)

Format & framing

Square (1:1) every time

Clean white / warm off-white paper background with lots of negative space

Soft feathered watercolor vignette edges (no hard frame/crop border)

Rendering style

Traditional watercolor realism (Sibley-ish vibe: accurate morphology, painterly washes, fine feather detail)

Controlled saturation (naturalistic; only “pop” where the species truly pops)

Subtle paper texture, gentle shadows, no digital gloss

Composition rules

The bird is the hero: single subject, centered-ish but not cookie-cutter centered

Avoid repetitive staging: don’t reuse the same perch angle, same pose, or always facing the same direction

Choose the “support” based on biology and what best showcases the bird:

Branch only if that species plausibly perches

Ground for ground birds / shorebirds

Water floating for waterfowl/loons/grebes, with minimal ripples/reflection

In-flight only when it genuinely best communicates ID/morphology (and keep background minimal)

Environment & props

If a perch/ground/water is shown, it should be habitat-appropriate

No decorative filler foliage

No generic mossy diagonal branch spam

If flora appears, it’s subtle + region/habitat specific, not “pretty garnish”
